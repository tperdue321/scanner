# scanner
checks a list of resources to see if they are available. returns a hash with a key/value for closed resources and open resources.

# Purpose
This is for personal use, and I expect it to only end up being used by me. However, anyone is welcome to use it and plug in their resources instead of mine if they want to skip writing mundane code. They also can fork it and abstract it a little more if they have a vision for this kind of simple module.
